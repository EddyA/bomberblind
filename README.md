- Bomberman and map Scrolling. 
  - The bomberman is centered to the screen and the map is scrolled until a border is reached.
  - When a border is reached, scrolling of the map is stopped and the bomberman starts moving.
- Randomly create the map with mutable/not mutable elements.
  - The number/proportion of elements is fully settable (for the moment in the code).
