# bomberblind
A bomberman alike game.

## Commands
- Use the arrow keys to move the bomberman.
- Key 'B' to put a bomb.

## For now
- Bombs and flames handling.
  - Bomberman dies when touched by a flame.
  - Bomb does explose when touched by a flame.
- Bomberman and map Scrolling. 
  - When moving: the bomberman is centered to the screen and the map is scrolled until a border is reached.
  - When a border is reached: the map scrolling is stopped and the bomberman starts moving.
- Randomly create the map with mutable/not mutable elements.
  - The number/proportion of elements is fully settable (for the moment in the code).
